# Seedhe_Maut_Website
The Seedhe Maut Fan Website is a personal project that I designed and developed from the ground up using HTML and CSS. This website is dedicated to one of my favorite rap duo, Seedhe Maut, and serves as a fan page to showcase their music, style, and essence.

I used a variety of modern web development techniques to create a visually engaging and responsive website. The site layout leverages CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure proper alignment, spacing, and structure across different devices. I incorporated CSS transitions and effects to enhance the user experience with smooth animations and hover effects.

For multimedia content, I embedded videos using iframes, allowing users to watch Seedhe Mautâ€™s music videos directly on the website without navigating away from the page. The design includes a fixed navigation bar for easy access to different sections, a header with a custom background, and a clean, modern UI that matches the aesthetic of the rap duo.

Though the project is currently static, I plan to further enhance it by integrating JavaScript to add dynamic content, interactive features, and animations. This will include features like music playlists, interactive galleries, and form handling, which will improve the website's functionality and user engagement.

I designed this project to refine my web development skills and experiment with creative layouts and styling. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are always welcome as I continue to develop this site. Feel free to explore the code, clone the repository, or reach out with any ideas!
